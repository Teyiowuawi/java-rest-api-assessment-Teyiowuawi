# **FTSE100 API**

## Description/ introduction
Dive into this FTSE100 API created using SpringBoot. 

Investing in stocks and shares is an effective way to make your money work for you and build wealth without you physically being present. 
The FTSE100 is made up of the top 100 companies in the UK by market capitalization and is generally a good place to start when investing however, popularity should not be the main motivator for investing in a stock.

The aim of this API is to help you to make an informed decision on which companies to invest in based on important valuation metrics. It uses a json file to store and retrieve data on financial metrics of all the companies in the FTSE100. 

Data model here??
- Importance for each metric in terms of stock performance! What does this signify?
